# Hacker News

## Site deployed on Netlify: [hn.matthewblode.com](https://hn.matthewblode.com/)

**Hacker News web app built using React and Redux.**

My Hacker News client is inspired by [HNPWA](https://hnpwa.com/) and [HN Premii](hn.premii.com). It is built using the best-in-class front-end technologies including React, Redux, and React Router.

## Local Installation

```
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
