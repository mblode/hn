/**
 * The trail back to the hub, rendered at the top of a zone's ROOT page.
 *
 * This file is the reference implementation. It is copied verbatim into each
 * zone repo (they are separate Next apps and cannot import from here), so keep
 * it dependency-free: no `next/link`, no icon package, no local `cn()`.
 *
 * Why it exists: `blode.co/hn` draws more visitors than any other page on the
 * site and bounces at 0.80. Its only edge back to the hub is a footer credit
 * sitting under an infinite-scroll feed, which in practice nobody reaches.
 * `zone-conventions.md` Rule 4 already asked for a visible trail; nothing
 * rendered one.
 *
 * Three constraints, all of them load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **Absolute `https://blode.co` hrefs.** A bare `href="/"` is not
 *    `basePath`-prefixed, so in a zone it resolves against the child's own
 *    origin and breaks on preview deployments.
 * 2. **Plain `<a>`, never `next/link`.** `next/link` would prefetch an RSC
 *    payload for a route this app does not own. These are also same-origin
 *    (a zone is blode.co behind a rewrite), so: same tab, and no
 *    `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, which only means something cross-origin.
 * 3. **The visible trail must match `BreadcrumbList` exactly.** Google treats a
 *    mismatch as a markup error. Both start at "Matthew Blode", not "Home":
 *    the root crumb is the one piece of chrome every zone shows above the fold,
 *    so it may as well say who made the thing.
 *
 * Root page only. Inner pages have their own navigation and a second trail
 * would just be noise.
