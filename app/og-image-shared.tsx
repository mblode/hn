/**
 * The house social card, shared by every blode.co zone. Rule 12 of
 * `blode-co/apps/web/.claude/knowledge/zone-conventions.md`; the original is
 * `renderZoneOgImage` in `blode-co/apps/web/lib/og-image.tsx`.
 *
 * Copied into each zone rather than published as a package, deliberately: a
 * package would make 33 repos share a release cadence and a dependency they do
 * not otherwise need, to save an edit that happens a few times a year. See the
 * note at the bottom of the conventions file.
 *
 * Before this card existed the fleet had eighteen unrelated designs, title
 * sizes from 68px to 168px, one zone printing its own URL back at itself, and
 * one rendering Geist Sans in a fleet where every app otherwise loads Glide.
 *
 * Three constraints, all load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **Satori cannot read woff2.** It throws `Unsupported OpenType signature
 *    wOF2`, a hard error rather than a silent fallback, so the variable woff2
 *    this app serves to browsers is unusable here. `lib/og-assets/` holds
 *    static TTF cuts instanced at wght 400 and 600 and subset to Latin-1 plus
 *    punctuation. Copy those files; do not regenerate them.
 * 2. **Satori parses neither `oklch()` nor CSS variables**, so every colour
 *    below is a hand-synced sRGB literal.
 * 3. **This is a `.tsx` route and must stay one.** Next emits a *static*
 *    metadata image file (`opengraph-image.png`) with `basePath` already on
 *    it, and `metadataBase` carries the basePath too (Rule 11), so the two
 *    stack up into `/zone/zone/opengraph-image.png`. A generated route is not
 *    prefixed, so this form is the one that cannot double.
