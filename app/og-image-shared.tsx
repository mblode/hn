/**
 * Layout helper for this zone's social card. The zone owns the route, the
 * brand colours, and the mark. This file only sets type in Glide and the
 * poster lockup (mark at the top, title on the baseline).
 *
 * It is not served by blode-co. `app/opengraph-image.tsx` in this repo is the
 * card; Next serves it at `/opengraph-image` on this zone's origin.
 *
 * Three constraints, all load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **Satori cannot read woff2.** It throws `Unsupported OpenType signature
 *    wOF2`, a hard error rather than a silent fallback, so the variable woff2
 *    this app serves to browsers is unusable here. `lib/og-assets/` holds
 *    static TTF cuts instanced at wght 400 and 600 and subset to Latin-1 plus
 *    punctuation. Copy those files; do not regenerate them.
 * 2. **Satori parses neither `oklch()` nor CSS variables**, so every colour
 *    passed in must be a hand-synced sRGB literal.
 * 3. **This is a `.tsx` route and must stay one.** Next emits a *static*
 *    metadata image file (`opengraph-image.png`) with `basePath` already on
 *    it, and `metadataBase` carries the basePath too, so the two stack up
 *    into `/zone/zone/opengraph-image.png`. A generated route is not
 *    prefixed, so this form is the one that cannot double.
